# Basic Data Types

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Some *C++* data types, their format specifiers, and their most common bit widths are as follows:

- *Int ("%d"):* 32 Bit integer
- *Long ("%ld"):* 64 bit integer
- *Char ("%c"):* Character type
- *Float ("%f"):* 32 bit real value
- *Double ("%lf"):* 64 bit real value

---

**Reading**  
To read a data type, use the following syntax:
	
    scanf("`format_specifier`", &val)

For example, to read a *character* followed by a *double*:

	char ch;
    double d;
    scanf("%c %lf", &ch, &d);

For the moment, we can ignore the spacing between format specifiers.

**Printing**  
To print a data type, use the following syntax:
	
    printf("`format_specifier`", val)

For example, to print a *character* followed by a *double*:

	char ch = 'd';
    double d = 234.432;
    printf("%c %lf", ch, d);
    

**Note:** You can also use *cin* and *cout* instead of *scanf* and *printf*; however, if you are taking a million numbers as input and printing a million lines, it is faster to use *scanf* and *printf*.

**Input Format**

Input consists of the following space-separated values: *int*, *long*, *char*, *float*, and *double*, respectively.

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

Print each element on a new line in the same order it was received as input. Note that the floating point value should be correct up to 3 decimal places and the double to 9 decimal places.

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i;
    long l;
    char c;
    float f;
    double d;

    cin >> i >> l >> c >> f >> d;

    cout << i << "\n";
    cout << l << "\n";
    cout << c << "\n";
    cout << fixed << setprecision(3) << f << "\n";
    cout << fixed << setprecision(9) << d << "\n";

    return 0;
}

```
